=== Scrivere il Bitcoin Book

((("bitcoin", "benefits of", id="BCbasicbenefits0")))((("decentralized systems", "bitcoin as")))I first stumbled upon bitcoin in mid-2011. My immediate reaction was more or less "Pfft! Nerd money!" and I ignored it for another six months, failing to grasp its importance. This is a reaction that I have seen repeated among many of the smartest people I know, which gives me some consolation. The second time I came across bitcoin, in a mailing list discussion, I decided to read the whitepaper written by Satoshi Nakamoto to study the authoritative source and see what it was all about. ((("digital currencies", "bitcoin vs. others")))I still remember the moment I finished reading those nine pages, when I realized that bitcoin was not simply a digital currency, but a network of trust that could also provide the basis for so much more than just currencies. The realization that "this isn't money, it's a decentralized trust network," started me on a four-month journey to devour every scrap of information about bitcoin I could find. I became obsessed and enthralled, spending 12 or more hours each day glued to a screen, reading, writing, coding, and learning as much as I could. I emerged from this state of fugue, more than 20 pounds lighter from lack of consistent meals, determined to dedicate myself to working on bitcoin.

Two years later, after creating a number of small startups to explore various bitcoin-related services and products, I decided that it was time to write my first book. Bitcoin was the topic that had driven me into a frenzy of creativity and consumed my thoughts; it was the most exciting technology I had encountered since the internet. It was now time to share my passion about this amazing technology with a broader audience.

=== Pubblico di Riferimento

((("intended audience")))This book is mostly intended for coders. If you can use a programming language, this book will teach you how cryptographic currencies work, how to use them, and how to develop software that works with them. The first few chapters are also suitable as an in-depth introduction to bitcoin for noncoders—those trying to understand the inner workings of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.

=== Perche' ci sono degli Insetti sulla Copertina?

((("decentralized systems", "in nature")))The leafcutter ant is a species that exhibits highly complex behavior in a colony super-organism, but each individual ant operates on a set of simple rules driven by social interaction and the exchange of chemical scents (pheromones). Per Wikipedia: "Next to humans, leafcutter ants form the largest and most complex animal societies on Earth." Leafcutter ants don't actually eat leaves, but rather use them to farm a fungus, which is the central food source for the colony. Get that? These ants are farming!

Although ants form a caste-based society and have a queen for producing offspring, there is no central authority or leader in an ant colony. The highly intelligent and sophisticated behavior exhibited by a multimillion-member colony is an emergent property from the interaction of the individuals in a social network.

La natura dimostra che i sistemi decentralizzati possono essere resilienti e produrre complessità inaspettate e incredibili sofisticazioni senza la necessità di un'autorità centrale, gerarchia, o di parti complesse.

((("decentralized systems", "benefits of")))Bitcoin is a highly sophisticated decentralized trust network that can support myriad financial processes. Yet, each node in the bitcoin network follows a few simple mathematical rules. The interaction between many nodes is what leads to the emergence of the sophisticated behavior, not any inherent complexity or trust in any single node. Like an ant colony, the bitcoin network is a resilient network of simple nodes following simple rules that together can do amazing things without any central coordination.((("", startref="BCbasicbenefits0")))

=== Esempi di Codice

((("code examples, obtaining and using", id="codeuse00")))The examples are illustrated in Python, C++, and using the command line of a Unix-like operating system such as Linux or macOS. All code snippets are available in the GitHub repository (https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook[https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook]) in the _code_ subdirectory of the main repo. Fork the book code, try the code examples, or submit corrections via GitHub.

Tutti i frammenti di codice possono essere replicati in gran parte dei sistemi operativi con un'installazione minimale di compilatori e interpreti per i rispettivi linguaggi. Dove necessario, forniamo istruzioni d'installazione basilari ed esempi passo-passo dell'output di quelle istruzioni.

Alcuni dei frammenti di codice e degli output sono stati riformattati per la stampa. In tutti questi casi le linee sono state divise da una barra rovesciata (\), seguita da un carattere newline. Quando si trascrivono gli esempi si rimuovano questi due caratteri e si uniscano di nuovo le linee; si dovrebbero vedere risultati identici a quelli nell'esempio.

Tutti i frammenti di codice usano dove possibile valori reali e calcoli, in modo che si possa costruire di esempio in esempio e vedere gli stessi risultati in ogni codice si scriva per calcolare gli stessi valori. Per esempio, le chiavi private e le corrispondenti chiavi pubbliche e indirizzi sono tutti reali. Le transazioni di prova, i blocchi, e i riferimenti in blockchain sono stati tutti introdotti nella reale catena dei blocchi bitcoin e sono parte del registro pubblico; dunque si possono consultare in qualsiasi sistema bitcoin.

=== Bitcoin Addresses and Transactions in This Book

((("getting started", "warnings and cautions")))((("warnings and cautions", "avoid sending money to addresses appearing in book")))((("keys and addresses", "warnings and cautions")))((("transactions", "warnings and cautions")))((("blockchain applications", "warnings and cautions")))((("QR codes", "warnings and cautions")))The bitcoin addresses, transactions, keys, QR codes, and blockchain data used in this book are, for the most part, real. That means you can browse the blockchain, look at the transactions offered as examples, retrieve them with your own scripts or programs, etc.

However, note that the private keys used to construct addresses are either printed in this book, or have been "burned." That means that if you send money to any of these addresses, the money will either be lost forever, or in some cases everyone who can read the book can take it using the private keys printed in here.

[WARNING]
====
DO NOT SEND MONEY TO ANY OF THE ADDRESSES IN THIS BOOK. Your money will be taken by another reader, or lost forever.((("", startref="codeuse00")))

=== Riconoscimenti

((("acknowledgments", id="acknowledge0")))This book represents the efforts and contributions of many people. I am grateful for all the help I received from friends, colleagues, and even complete strangers, who joined me in this effort to write the definitive technical book on cryptocurrencies and bitcoin.

E 'impossibile fare una distinzione tra la tecnologia Bitcoin e la comunità bitcoin, e questo libro è tanto un prodotto di quella comunità quanto è un libro sulla tecnologia Bitcoin. Il mio lavoro su questo libro è stato incoraggiato, acclamato, sostenuto, e premiato da tutta la comunità bitcoin dall'inizio fino alla fine. Più di ogni altra cosa, questo libro mi ha permesso di essere parte di una comunità meravigliosa per due anni e non posso ringraziarvi abbastanza per avermi accettato in questa comunità. Ci sono troppe persone da menzionare per nome, persone che ho incontrato in occasione di conferenze, eventi, seminari, meetup, pizza e piccoli incontri privati, così come molti che comunicavano con me via Twitter, su reddit, su bitcointalk.org, e su GitHub che hanno avuto un impatto su questo libro. Ogni idea, analogia, domanda, risposta, e spiegazione che si trova in questo libro è stata, ad un certo punto, ispirata , provata, o migliorata attraverso le mie interazioni con la comunità. Grazie a tutti per il vostro sostegno; senza di voi questo libro non sarebbe nato. Sarò per sempre grato di tutto questo.

The journey to becoming an author starts long before the first book, of course. My first language (and schooling) was Greek, so I had to take a remedial English writing course in my first year of university. I owe thanks to Diana Kordas, my English writing teacher, who helped me build confidence and skills that year. Later, as a professional, I developed my technical writing skills on the topic of data centers, writing for _Network World_ magazine. I owe thanks to John Dix and John Gallant, who gave me my first writing job as a columnist at _Network World_ and to my editor Michael Cooney and my colleague Johna Till Johnson who edited my columns and made them fit for publication. Writing 500 words a week for four years gave me enough experience to eventually consider becoming an author.

Thanks also to those who supported me when I submitted my book proposal to O'Reilly, by providing references and reviewing the proposal. Specifically, thanks to John Gallant, Gregory Ness, Richard Stiennon, Joel Snyder, Adam B. Levine, Sandra Gittlen, John Dix, Johna Till Johnson, Roger Ver, and Jon Matonis. Special thanks to Richard Kagan and Tymon Mattoszko, who reviewed early versions of the proposal and Matthew Taylor, who copyedited the proposal.

Thanks to Cricket Liu, author of the O'Reilly title _DNS and BIND_, who introduced me to O'Reilly. Thanks also to Michael Loukides and Allyson MacDonald at O'Reilly, who worked for months to help make this book happen. Allyson was especially patient when deadlines were missed and deliverables delayed as life intervened in our planned schedule. For the second edition, I thank Timothy McGovern for guiding the process, Kim Cofer for patiently editing, and Rebecca Panzer for illustrating many new diagrams.

The first few drafts of the first few chapters were the hardest, because bitcoin is a difficult subject to unravel. Every time I pulled on one thread of the bitcoin technology, I had to pull on the whole thing. I repeatedly got stuck and a bit despondent as I struggled to make the topic easy to understand and create a narrative around such a dense technical subject. Eventually, I decided to tell the story of bitcoin through the stories of the people using bitcoin and the whole book became a lot easier to write. I owe thanks to my friend and mentor, Richard Kagan, who helped me unravel the story and get past the moments of writer's block. I thank Pamela Morgan, who reviewed early drafts of each chapter in the first and second edition of the book, and asked the hard questions to make them better. Also, thanks to the developers of the San Francisco Bitcoin Developers Meetup group as well as Taariq Lewis and Denise Terry for helping test the early material. Thanks also to Andrew Naugler for infographic design.

During the development of the book, I made early drafts available on GitHub and invited public comments. More than a hundred comments, suggestions, corrections, and contributions were submitted in response. Those contributions are explicitly acknowledged, with my thanks, in <<github_contrib>>. Most of all, my sincere thanks to my volunteer GitHub editors Ming T. Nguyen (1st edition) and Will Binns (2nd edition), who worked tirelessly to curate, manage and resolve pull requests, issue reports, and perform bug fixes on GitHub.

Quando il libro era nella fase di bozza, è passato attraverso molti round di revisione tecnica. Grazie a Cricket Liu e a Lorne Lantz per la loro revisione approfondita, commenti e supporto. 

Several bitcoin developers contributed code samples, reviews, comments, and encouragement. Thanks to Amir Taaki and Eric Voskuil for example code snippets and many great comments; Chris Kleeschulte for contributing the Bitcore appendix; Vitalik Buterin and Richard Kiss for help with elliptic curve math and code contributions; Gavin Andresen for corrections, comments, and encouragement; Michalis Kargakis for comments, contributions, and btcd writeup; and Robin Inge for errata submissions improving the second print. In the second edition, I again received a lot of help from many Bitcoin Core developers, including Eric Lombrozo who demystified Segregated Witness, Luke Dashjr who helped improve the chapter on transactions, Johnson Lau who reviewed Segregated Witness and other chapters, and many others. I owe thanks to Joseph Poon, Tadge Dryja, and Olaoluwa Osuntokun who explained Lightning Network, reviewed my writing, and answered questions when I got stuck.

Devo tutto l'amore che ho per le parole e per i libri a mia madre, Theresa, che mi ha cresciuto in una casa con libri     che potevi trovare a ogni parete. Mia madre mi ha inoltre comprato il mio primo computer nel 1982, anche se si considera una che ha un po paura della tecnologia. Mio padre, Meneleaos, un ingegnere civile che ha appena pubblicato il suo libro a 80 anni, era colui che mi ha insegnato il pensiero logico e analitico e mi ha trasmesso un'amore per la scienza e l'ingegneria.   

Grazie a tutti per avermi aiutato durante questo viaggio.
